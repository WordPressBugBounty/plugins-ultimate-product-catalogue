Add a product catalog to your site with blocks or shortcodes. Works with WooCommerce or standalone. Flexible and customizable, works with any theme.

== Description ==

The ultimate catalog plugin to showcase your products in a sleek and modern layout. Fully responsive and comes with a powerful feature set that is easy to customize.

üë©‚Äçüíª [Demo](https://www.etoilewebdesign.com/ultimate-product-catalogue-demo/) | üåü [Premium](https://www.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-product-catalog/) | ‚ÑπÔ∏è [Support](https://www.etoilewebdesign.com/support-center/)

Comes with customizable **Gutenberg blocks** and **shortcodes**, so you can display either your whole catalog or just individual products on any page, no matter which page editing system or builder you are using. We also **include several patterns**, so you can integrate your products and catalog directly into your block-based theme.

### Key Features

- 3 catalog layouts that can be dynamically viewed and switched by the user with no page reload.
- Powerful product catalog filtering and sorting system, including for categories, sub-categories, price and product name. All handled in real time with asynchronous requests, so no page reloads. 
- Dynamic product search that works with the filtering, so your customers can quickly find exactly what they're looking for in the catalog. 
- Set sale prices for products and easily toggle sale prices on and off for the entire catalog or individual products.
- Organize your product catalog into categories and sub-categories to make searching and filtering products easy.
- Includes extra blocks to add a product catalog search field as well as to display recent products, a product list or random products anywhere on your site.

### Set up in < 5 Minutes!

The Ultimate Product Catalog comes with a user-friendly walk-through that runs automatically when you activate the plugin and will help you create your first products and catalog, and display them on your site in just a few minutes.

### Add the Catalog to Any Page

Simply insert the *Display Product Catalog* block or either of the shortcodes below (replacing the "X" with the actual ID of your product catalog) to add a product catalog with filters to any page.

`[product-catalogue id="X"] or [product-catalog id="X"]
`

### Customize Your Catalog

The plugin comes with several features that will help you to offer a great experience for your customers and visitors. These include the ability to set up a **product catalog overview page**, which shows a thumbnail of each product category and lets people click through to view just those products, a **separate block (and shortcode) to display a list of featured products** (instead of the whole catalog), a **price slider** for filtering, different **sale modes** and much more!

Additionally, it's easy to modify the styling of your product catalog with custom CSS, which will help it to further fit with the look of your site. We provide a list of the most common classes from our plugin, as well as an example of how to implement custom CSS, [in our documentation](https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-product-catalog/user/styling/css).

It's the perfect solution to create a product catalog for your store, agency, art gallery, restaurant and more!

### Additional Features

Some other great features included with the Ultimate Product Catalog plugin are:

- Catalog overview mode, showing category or sub-category images (such as brands, etc.).
- Choose currency symbol and location.
- Price slider that lets you filter the catalog for products that match exact price criteria.
- Easy-to-use block and shortcode attributes that let you set a starting layout, exclude layouts, hide the sidebar, etc.
- Make use of URL parameters to load the product catalog with a specific category already pre-selected.
- Thumbnail support option, which displays a smaller version of your product image, to help with catalog page load times.
- Easy-to-use and comprehensive settings page, which makes it easy to customize product catalog features.
- Several different breadcrumbs options for your product catalog.

### Affiliate Catalog

The Ultimate Product Catalog is also a great solution for those who are running affiliate stores, in which you link out to products for sale on other sites. With the ability to specify a unique link for each product (using the "Product Link" field), you can insert your affiliate link and then set it up so that, when someone clicks on a product in your catalog, they are brought to that link instead of the product page in the plugin. You get all the benefits and functionality of the Ultimate Product Catalog while being able to sell as an affiliate.
